## ðŸŽ® About the project

**Don't Look Behind You** is a short 2D suspense game where you play as a child fleeing from a terrifying monster that only emerges in the darkness. As you run, staying in the light becomes your only way to survive. The gameplay combines auto-running mechanics with reactive platforming and light-based puzzle elements to create tension and urgency.

This game was made for the UNGames 4D4H jam, for 4 days and 4 hours, my fellow artist and audio composer partner and I delved into planning and developing this exciting video game that was awarded as the game with the best sound design and the best game of the jam!
